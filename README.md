# SpotFetch :

![SpotFetch Demo](./.github/demo.png)


A simple python program to download Music from various platfroms using yt-dlp ( The audio source is YouTube or YouTube Music ).

## What it can do :

- Download Spotify playlists after exporting the playlist as a csv file from [Exportify](https://exportify.app)
- batch download music from a .txt file with URLs one by line, or using a custom CSV file with headers *name,artist*
- Direct download from a Youtube url, can be a video or playlist.
- Search then download a song using its name and artist name.
- Audio is downloaded as MP3, M4A, or FLAC.
- Song cover or thumbnail are always embedded, alongside numerous metadata.
- You can use a cookie file in case YouTube rate limits your session.
- Download using either YouTube music or Youtube.
- You can download from platforms other than Spotify if you convert your playlists as CSVs using services like tunemymusic.com .

# Installation :

### Requirements :

- First make sure you have ffmpeg installed on your machine [Download here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
- Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed too, and is in your system path.
- If you dont have Git to clone the repo thats fine, you can download it as a zip file and uncompress it, see [here](.github/if_no_git.png).

### setup :

- Clone this repository ( or just download it as a zip file and uncompress it ):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrElyazid/SpotFetch.git
```

- then :

```bash
cd SpotFetch
```

- Install `requirements.txt` ( preferably use a new virtual environement ):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Thats it, now run `menu.py` :

```bash
python3 menu.py
# or python menu.py
# or py menu.py
```

### note :
It is recommended to use a virtual environement since installing requirements globally on your machine is generally bad,
before running `pip install -r requirements.txt` make sure you [create](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) and then [activate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work) a venv, and if on Windows and running powershell you might need to run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` before activating the venv.


## Usage

### Traditional Menu Interface

Run the interactive menu:

```bash
python3 menu.py
```

### CLI Mode (New!)

For scripting and automation, use the CLI tool to avoid terminal menus:

```bash
python3 cli.py --input-csv PATH_TO_CSV --output PATH_TO_OUTPUT [OPTIONS]
```

Or use the shorthand:

```bash
./spotfetch --input-csv PATH_TO_CSV --output PATH_TO_OUTPUT [OPTIONS]
```

#### CLI Examples

**Single CSV file:**
```bash
python3 cli.py --input-csv ~/playlists/my_playlist.csv --output ~/downloads
```

**Batch mode - process all CSVs in a folder:**
```bash
python3 cli.py --input-csv ~/playlists/*.csv --output ~/downloads
```

**Specify audio format and platform:**
```bash
python3 cli.py --input-csv playlist.csv --output ./downloads --format flac --platform youtube
```

**Use cookie file for age-restricted content:**
```bash
python3 cli.py --input-csv playlist.csv --output ./downloads --cookies ~/youtube_cookies.txt
```

**Disable automatic CSV format detection:**
```bash
python3 cli.py --input-csv playlist.csv --output ./downloads --no-detect
```

**Verbose output for debugging:**
```bash
python3 cli.py --input-csv playlist.csv --output ./downloads --verbose
```

#### CLI Options

- `-i, --input-csv PATH`: Path to CSV file(s). Supports glob patterns like `./playlists/*.csv` (required)
- `-o, --output PATH`: Base output directory where folders will be created (required)
- `-f, --format {mp3,m4a,flac}`: Audio format (default: mp3)
- `-p, --platform {youtube,ytmusic}`: Download platform (default: ytmusic)
- `-c, --cookies PATH`: Path to cookies file for age-restricted content
- `--no-detect`: Disable automatic CSV format detection, use custom format
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose output for debugging

#### CLI Features

- **Automatic CSV format detection**: Detects Exportify, TuneMyMusic, and custom CSV formats
- **Folder creation**: Automatically creates a subfolder with the CSV filename for organized output
- **Batch processing**: Use glob patterns to process multiple CSV files at once
- **Progress tracking**: Visual progress indicators during downloads
- **Flexible format support**: MP3, M4A (M4B), and FLAC
- **Platform selection**: Choose between YouTube Music (default) or YouTube
- **Cookie support**: Handle age-restricted content with cookie files


## Some details :


### I get `track_name error` or errors when parsing the csv :

Make sure the language set in Exportify is English.

### How does the program set the best quality and bitrate ?

First off, YouTube uses adaptive streaming, the best available quality for a video can change depending on variables like the server load, location ... etc, to get the best available quality at the time of the request, the argument `bestaudio` for yt-dlp ensures exactly that, and then comes the transcoding, when converting from the `bestaudio` format ( which is often opus or vorbis in WebM containers ) to `mp3` or `m4a` the argument `prefferedqyality: '0'` is used, this ensures we dont produce a bloated transcode and perform VBR encoding instead of just setting the maximum bitrate which will just result in a large file size for the audio, note that for `flac` this last argument is ignored since the format is lossless.

in short : **the best quality possible is always chosen.**

### how to use a cookie file ?:

Use the following extensions to get cookies for YouTube depending on your browser : [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc?pli=1), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/).

You can read more about using cookies with yt-dlp [here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-yt-dlp)
Note that you need to have a javascript runtime installed for the cookies to work, [deno](https://deno.com/) is recommended, read more here : https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/EJS 
### Download Platform Selection

- **YouTube Music** (default): Works best for popular songs and if you don't want to download video clip audio.
- **YouTube**: Works best for niche and lesser-known songs and artists.


### How should the urls txt file look like ?

simply put each link in a line with no quotes, example :
```bash
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=zQ_s7NhWcPgEQ46b
https://youtu.be/6-8E4Nirh9s?si=e7LKPptaE6vEEI48
https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=k-3y2LVF_SE&si=G2Dtl4LUbzjGIcpy
```

### How should the custom CSV file look like ?

the headers are name,artist an example :
```bash
name,artist
"in the end","linkin park"
"under pressure","queen"
"time","pink floyd"
```

### I keep getting 403 Forbidden Error :

If you get `ERROR: unable to download video data: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden` when trying to download, this is probably because yt-dlp needs to be updated, you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade` to update it.

Also if using a venv, make sure you activate it before each launch of the app.

## Using SpotFetch on Android :

since SpotFetch is just a python program, you can run it on any machine with python installed, you can run it on Android via [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) ( you can also find Termux on Google play ), after installation follow these commands :

- Upgrade your system packages :

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```
Make sure to type Enter whenever needed while upgrading.


- Install python, git, ffmpeg:

```bash
pkg install git python ffmpeg
```

- Clone this repo :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrElyazid/SpotFetch
```

- cd into the directory :

```bash
cd SpotFetch/
```
- install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Rotate your phone :
do it so that the terminal UI doesnt look awful :/

- Run `menu.py` :

```bash
python menu.py
```

Thats it, after downloading try to locate where Termux stores files on your Android and access your downloaded files there.
